# SSH Authorized Keys - Placeholder
# This file will be overridden by environment-specific builds
# 
# Each deployment environment should provide its own authorized_keys file
# containing the public SSH keys that should have access to the container.
#
# Format: One public key per line
# Example:
# ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza... user@hostname
# ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza... user@hostname
