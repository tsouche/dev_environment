# dev_environment

This project is about delivering a versionned Dev environment to code on Win11:
- I use VS Code running on Win11 as IDE
- I deploy a Ubuntu container with Docker Desktop on Win11
- In this container, I deploy SSH and rust toolchain

I then use VS Code to access the container, thus benefitting from the best of both worlds:
- I can do my usual work on Win11, using mostly office tools
- and I dev within a Linux environment
